# canvas-engine
A simple html canvas render framework. Includes a camera, object base class, runtime loop.

Started off life as part of [this random project](https://github.com/sunmockyang/pLink), came to solidify in [this visualizer](https://github.com/sunmockyang/github-visualizer), hopefully to come into its own in this repo.

Check out the [demo in action](https://sunmockyang.github.io/canvas-engine/demo/index.html)
